'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 
9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. 906609

HIGH LEVEL ALGORITHM
Build a collection of all palindromic numbers consisting of 6 digits
Working backwards, find the first palindrome that has a 3 digit factor
If the 3-digit factor divided into the palindromic number is also a 3-digit number, we are set

Build palindromic numbers collection
A01 [get numbers in the 100 to 999 range] for i in range(100,1000) 
A02 [get their digits] digits <-- str(i)
